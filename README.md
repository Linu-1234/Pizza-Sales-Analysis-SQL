# Pizza-Sales-Analysis-SQL
This project uses SQL to analyze pizza sales data, focusing on revenue, popular pizza types, and order trends, providing key insights for sales and inventory management.
## Project Overview
- The database contains comprehensive information about pizza orders, including details about orders, pizzas, pizza types, and their pricing. 
- Using MySQL, I have written and executed queries to address various business-related questions, such as analyzing sales trends, identifying popular pizza types and sizes, and evaluating revenue contributions by category.
- The project is divided into three levels of complexity:
   1. Basic
   2. Intermediate
   3. Advanced
##### Basic:
- Straightforward queries to retrieve foundational insights, such as the total number of orders, total revenue generated, the most common pizza size, and the highest-priced pizza.

##### Intermediate:
- Moderate-level queries aimed at uncovering deeper insights, such as the distribution of orders by hour, the total quantity of pizzas ordered by category, and the average number of pizzas ordered per day. 
- These queries also include identifying the most ordered pizza types based on revenue.

##### Advanced
- Complex queries leveraging advanced SQL techniques, such as calculating the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue, analyzing cumulative revenue trends over time, and determining the top 3 most ordered pizza types by revenue for each category.
-  These queries employ advanced concepts like window functions, subqueries, and ranking.

- This project showcases proficient SQL skills, including the use of JOINs, GROUP BY, window functions, CTEs, and aggregations, to solve real-world data analysis challenges. 
- It demonstrates how relational databases can provide actionable insights to optimize business decisions, such as inventory management, pricing strategies, and customer preferences.
